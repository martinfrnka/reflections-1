Q1. - When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?
A1. - During collaboration with other users and for sharing
my awesome projects with the world.

Q2. - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?
A2. - Just like i want to make my commits manually and push
them to GitHub manually having made logical changes, i'd like
to pull changes from GitHub to my local repo manually so i
know exactly what am incorporating into my local repo.
